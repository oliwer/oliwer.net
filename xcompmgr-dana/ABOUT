Since Dana's GIT repository has been closed, I've decided to host the last
version of Dana's xcompmgr here. This version includes the patch to fix the
Conky rendering issue.

dana-xcompmgr is a fork of the official xcompmgr (at version 1.3) which adds
a menu transparency feature. Although it has been abandoned for years, I
still use it everyday without any problem.
